# Hangman

## Project Outline

This project is an elixir based cli application to play hangman. This application was created in hopes to learn the uniqueness of this pattern matching language. Along this journey, I was able to:

- Discover the complexities of Genservers and Supervisors
- Explore the benefits of pattern matching
- Truly understand the differences between functional and Object Oriented programming.
