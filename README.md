# Hangman

## Project Outline

This project is an elixir based cli application to play hangman. This application was created in hopes to learn the uniqueness of this pattern matching language. Along this journey, I was able to:

- Discover the complexities of Genservers and Supervisors
- Explore the benefits of pattern matching
- Truly understand the differences between functional and Object Oriented programming.

## Project Boot-up instructions

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Installing Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directories will be done when running `mix setup` within the following apps: `dictionary` and `myApp`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
